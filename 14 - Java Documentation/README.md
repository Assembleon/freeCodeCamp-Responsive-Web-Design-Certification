## User Stories from freeCodeCamp - Technical Documentation Page

- You can see a `main` element with a corresponding `id="main-doc"`, which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).
- Within the `#main-doc` element, you can see several `section` elements, each with a class of `main-section`. There are at least five sections.
- The first element within each `.main-section` is a `header` element, which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
- Each `section` element with the class of `main-section` has an `id` that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it, with spaces replaced by underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" has a corresponding `id="JavaScript_and_Java"`).
- The `.main-section` elements contain at least ten `p` elements in total.
- The `.main-section` elements contain at least five `code` elements in total.
- The `.main-section` elements contain at least five `li` items in total.
- You can see a `nav` element with a corresponding `id="navbar"`.
- The navbar element contains one `header` element which describes the topic of the technical documentation.
- Additionally, the navbar contains link (`a`) elements with the class of `nav-link`. There is one for every element with the class `main-section`.
- The header element in the `#navbar` comes before any link (`a`) elements in the navbar.
- Each element with the class of `nav-link` contains text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello World" section/header, your navbar has an element which contains the text "Hello World").
- When you click on a navbar element, the page navigates to the corresponding section of the `#main-doc` element (e.g. If you click on a `.nav-link` element that contains the text "Hello World", the page navigates to a section element with that id, and contains the corresponding header).
- On regular-sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with `id="navbar"` is shown on the left side of the screen and is always visible to the user.
- The technical documentation uses at least one media query.
